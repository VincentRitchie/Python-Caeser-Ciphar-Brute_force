# Python-Caeser-Ciphar-Brute_force

Caesar Cipher Project

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher. The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

Features
- Encryption: Encrypts a given plaintext message using a specified number of shift keys.
- Decryption: Decrypts a given ciphertext message using a specified number of shift keys.
- Brute Force Decryption: Attempts to decrypt a given ciphertext message by trying all possible shifts (1-25) and displaying the results.

Future Enhancements
1. Support for Uppercase Letters: Extend the cipher to handle uppercase letters.
2. Enhanced Brute Force Output: Improve the brute force decryption to highlight the most likely original text.
3. User Interface: Develop a simple GUI for the program to improve user experience.
4. Save/Load Functionality: Allow users to save encrypted/decrypted messages to a file and load them later.
5. Support for Non-English Alphabets: Extend the cipher to support other alphabets.
6. Integration with Common Word List: Cross-reference brute force results with a common word list to identify potential valid decryptions.
7. Security Analysis: Add functionality to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the Caesar Cipher against modern encryption standards.
